# **Capital Bikeshare Demand Prediction**

by: Muhammad Sultan Pasya

## **Context**
Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) serves Washington, D.C., and parts of its metropolitan area, with over 700 stations and 5,400 bikes as of January 2023. These automated bike rentals enhance urban mobility, reduce environmental impact, and promote health. Since launching in 2010, CaBi has generated rich data on user behavior and traffic patterns, offering insights valuable for urban planning and transportation.

Capital Bikeshare faces challenges in efficiently managing its 700+ stations and 5,400 bikes across Washington, D.C. and surrounding areas. The unpredictable nature of bike demand, influenced by factors such as weather, time of day, and seasonal variations, makes it difficult to ensure optimal bike availability and station capacity. Without accurate demand predictions, the system risks either overstocking or understocking bikes at various locations, leading to inefficient operations and a suboptimal user experience.

## **Problem Statement**
So, the big question is: **How to predict bike demand to improve station operations and balance bike availability throughout the day?**

## **Goals**
To solve this, we aim to build a model that predicts bike rental demand based on key factors like weather, temperature, and time. These predictions will help optimize station operations, balance bike availability, and enhance service efficiency, enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.
